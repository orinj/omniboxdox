# omniboxdox

This repository hosts interactive navigable documentation for Chromium omnibox classes. It's generated by a hand-crafted, plugin-enhanced doxygen configuration focused on specific interrelated parts of the Chromium codebase, intended to provide insight into how omnibox classes work together. Chromium Code Search remains the primary tool for understanding the state of all Chromium code, including the omnibox. The doxygen snapshots here are a supplement to enhance understanding of the omnibox in particular by providing lots of visual diagrams and quick navigation. It provides a broader view with less detail than code search, and that can be a good thing!
