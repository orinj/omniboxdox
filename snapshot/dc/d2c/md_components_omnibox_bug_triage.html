<p>Instructions for Chrome omnibox engineers serving an assigned bug triage rotation.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md1"></a>
Goal of the process</h1>
<p>Every omnibox bug is triaged, preferably within a week of being filed. This means making the issue clear, marking it as a dup if necessary, revising the status, setting a priority, labeling/categorizing as appropriate (or handing off to another component), and (possibly) assigning an owner. The only reason bugs should remain untriaged (i.e., <em>status=Unconfirmed</em> or <em>status=Untriaged</em>) is because of they need additional information from someone. These bugs should be labeled as such (<em>Needs=Feedback</em> or <em>Needs=TestConfirmation</em>).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2"></a>
Non-goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ensure high priority bugs or regressions are making progress / ping bug owners for progress updates on other important bugs. (Trust your teammates to work on assigned bugs.)</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md3"></a>
Process</h1>
<ul>
<li>Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, the triage engineer looks over <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=2&amp;q=component%3AUI%3EBrowser%3EOmnibox+status%3AUnconfirmed%2CUntriaged+-component%3AUI%3EBrowser%3EOmnibox%3ESecurityIndicators+-Needs%3DFeedback&amp;colspec=ID+Pri+M+Stars+ReleaseBlock+Component+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified&amp;x=m&amp;y=releaseblock&amp;cells=ids">all <em>Unconfirmed</em> and <em>Untriaged</em> omnibox bugs (without <em>Needs=Feedback</em>)</a> and triages them.</li>

How to triage chromium bugs</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md5"></a>
Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of labels, components, and priority are to make it easy for omnibox team members to identify bugs at a glance that affect a particular area. In other words, this bug management process is intended to make the team more efficient and provide better visibility for team members to identify what’s important to work on in particular areas.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md6"></a>
Identifying the issue</h2>
<p>If the bug isn’t clear, or the desired outcome is unclear, please apply the label <em>Needs-Feedback</em> and courteously ask for clarification. This is appropriate both for external bug filers, Chromium developers on other teams, or Googlers. The label is merely an indication that this bug needs information from someone outside the team in order to make progress. It’s also an indication that someone on the team needs to follow-up if feedback is not forthcoming.</p>
<p>Often the appropriate request includes a request for chrome://omnibox data; <a href="../../#Example-request-for-chrome_omnibox-data">an example such request</a> is below.</p>
<p>Also, if the bug is clear, try to reproduce. If it cannot be reproduced or you lack the necessary setup, either ask the reporter for clarification or add the label <em>Needs-TestConfirmation</em> as appropriate.</p>
<p>Some bugs are feature requests. Marks these as Feature, not Bug. It’s likely a feature may have been requested before. Search the bugs database and dup appropriately.</p>
<p>Some <a href="../../#Commonly-referenced-bugs">commonly requested features and commonly reported bugs</a> are listed below.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md7"></a>
Status</h2>
<p>Set the Status field to the following value depending on the triage action taken:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Available</em>: The typical state for bugs exiting the triage process, assuming none of the other states below apply.</li>
<li><em>Assigned</em>: <em>Available</em> bugs with Owners; see <a href="../../#Owners">section on assigning owners</a>.</li>
<li><em>ExternalDependency</em>: Bugs that turn out to be in another project's code and you've contacted that other project. Typically this is problems with Google-sourced suggestions, an IME, or a Chrome extension. In all cases, file a bug or contact the appropriate team and post information about this outreach (e.g., a bug number) in a comment on the Chromium bug.</li>
<li><em>Duplicate</em>: This issue has been reported in another bug or shares the same root cause as another bug and will certainly be fixed simultaneously.</li>
<li><em>WontFix</em>: Anything working by design. Also applies to old non-reproducible bugs or bugs lacking feedback per <a href="http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/bug-triage#TOC-Cleaning-up-old-bugs">standard Chromium policies</a>.</li>
<li><em>Unconfirmed</em> or <em>Untriaged</em>: These labels are generally only appropriate if you labeled the bug with <em>Needs-Feedback</em> or <em>Needs-TestConfirmation</em>, otherwise in effect you're kicking the can down the road to the next triage engineer.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md8"></a>
Priority</h2>
<p>Follow <a href="https://www.chromium.org/for-testers/bug-reporting-guidelines/triage-best-practices">standard Chromium policies</a>. <em>Priority-2</em> represents wanted for this release but can be punted for a release. <em>Priority-3</em> are bugs not time sensitive. There is an even-lower-priority state; see the <em>NextAction=01/07/2020</em> below.</p>
<p>If you aren't sure of the scope, severity, or implications of an issue, prefer to assign it a higher priority (<em>1</em> or <em>2</em>) and try to assign it to someone appropriate to look into further or at least identify the scope / true priority. If you cannot identify a person to assign it to, it would be better to leave it <em>Untriaged</em> for the next triage engineer than mark it <em>Available</em> just to try to clear the queue.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md9"></a>
Owners</h2>
<p>Generally only assign someone else to own a bug if the bug is <em>Priority-2</em> or better. <em>Priority-3</em> bugs are not likely to be completed soon; for these bugs, don’t assign an owner to merely sit on the bug. To draw someone’s attention to a bug, explicitly CC them.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md10"></a>
Categorization</h2>
<p>Omnibox bugs use a combination of labels (including hotlists) and subcomponents to indicate their topic.</p>
<p>Most omnibox bugs should be in the main omnibox component. A few will fall directly into a subcomponent instead; the available subcomponents are listed below.</p>
<p>Add all the labels, components, and next actions dates that seem appropriate to the issue. The main ones encountered by omnibox issues are listed below; feel free to use additional suitable ones as well.</p>
<p>The main labels that apply to bugs include:</p>

<tr class="markdownTableRowOdd">

<p>If the bug is extremely low priority, set the <b>NextAction field</b> to <b>01/07/2021</b> and mention that we will "reassess" the bug next year. This NextAction field is for Priority-3 bugs that are somehow less important than other <em>priority-3</em> bugs. These are bugs we’re sure no one on the team intends to fix this year (e.g., really unimportant, or mostly unimportant and hard to fix). This label should be applied only when confident the whole team will agree with you. When searching the bugs database for things to do, I suggest excluding bugs on this hotlist.)</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md11"></a>
How to triage alerts</h1>
<p>Every message sent to <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome-omnibox-team-alerts">chrome-omnibox-team-alerts&lt;/a&gt; should be evaluated by a triage engineer. The triage engineer should either eitherfile a Chromium bug to investigate the issue further and reply to the alert with a link to the Chromium bug, ororreply to the alert explaining that the alert is already being tracked, and link to the appropriate Chromium bug, ororreply to the alert explaining why ignoring the alert is appropriate. This is only appropriate if the engineer believes the alert is incorrect or spurious. <b>Tip</b>: Alerts on Beta and Stable that happen at the time of a new version release will often have triggered an alert on Dev. Look for those Dev alerts. Most likely they already have associated bugs. If the Beta/Stable change is the same scale at the Dev change, it's likely the same issue&ndash;you should simply point the Beta/Stable alert thread to the existing bug thread.  With this process, when the next triage engineer begins their triage rotation, they'll be able to see which alerts have been handled and which have not. All alerts that have been handled will have a reply from a triage engineer. All alerts that have not been looked at will not. Sometimes multiple alerts will be fired at around the same time, on the same channel, on related histograms. All of these alerts can be filed as part of the same bug if the triage engineer thinks they're likely all related (as they likely are). All these alerts should be mentioned in the bug and all the separate alert threads should be replied to pointing to that bug. When filing the bug about an alert: alert:Leave it <em>Untriaged</em>. You should investigate it during your triage shift; if you don't identify a root cause, the next triager will see the bug and try. Only assign an owner if the likely root cause has been determined!determined!Add the Restrict-View-Google label so metrics can be discussed without fear of leaking sensitive information..Link to the alert message..Set a priority. Generally these bugs should be <em>Priority-1</em> or <em>Priority-2</em>..Tag it with a milestone (if appropriate)..Likely, label it with either Performance-Browser or Hotlist-OmniboxRanking. (Probably one of those is appropriate.) @subsection autotoc_md12 Investigating an Alert The timeline dashboard</a> is your friend, especially the split by channel, split by platform, split by milestone, and split by version features. Some tips on how to investigate using the timeline dashboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the regression is on Dev, see if you can spot it on Canary. That can usually indicate a narrow regression range. This can usually be done unless the histogram is too noisy.</li>
<li>What platforms did the regression happen on? That might narrow down the area of relevant code.</li>
<li>Did the regression happen on multiple channels at the same time? If so, then it's either caused by a change that was submitted and quickly merged to multiple channels or it may be caused by something external to Chrome (such as a major holiday or significant weather events, which can change omnibox behavior).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Action</b>: The best way to verify that a particular changelist caused a regression is to <b>revert the changelist</b> and see if the metrics improve. This is a better strategy than landing a fix directly. If the "fix" doesn't make the metric recover to the exact same degree as the regression, it's unclear whether the fix was related to the regression, only a partial solution, and whether there's still another issue.</p>
<p>FYI: the alerting system does not alert on ChromeOS changes because the vast majority of alerts that trigger on ChromeOS are due to school schedules (e.g., summer and winter vacation). For the year prior to disabling ChromeOS alerts, we did not see a real ChromeOS alert that wasn't also fired on Windows. (I.e., all real regressions on ChromeOS were also regressions on Windows; Views platforms tend to regress simultaneously.) Thus, we seemingly don't get any additional value from ChromeOS alerts.</p>

Example request for chrome://omnibox data</h2>
<p>NOTE: If you ask someone for chrome://omnibox data on a public bug, label the bug with Restrict-View-Google so that any personal data from the reporter's chrome://omnibox output is not made public. Do this <em>before</em> they respond. As the original reporter, they should still have access to the bug even with the restrict applied.</p>
<p>Example request:</p>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>Please visit chrome://omnibox in the version of Chrome in which you're experiencing the issue and type the input that triggers the issue into the "Enter omnibox input" text box. Then click the Download link and attach the downloaded file to this issue.</p>
<p>Please be aware that this data may reveal details of your browsing history so only attach the file if you're comfortable sharing that data with the omnibox team. I have added the Restrict-View-Google label to this issue so that it is not visible to the public. </p>
</blockquote>

Commonly referenced bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>“I want the option to turn off inline autocomplete.” Dup against <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=91378">crbug/91378</a>.<ul>
<li>Try to understand the motivation of the user making the request. Please ask the user for examples, with chrome://omnibox detail (see above), of times where the omnibox doesn’t do what they want. Ideally we should be able make to make the omnibox smart enough that such a feature isn’t necessary.</li>
